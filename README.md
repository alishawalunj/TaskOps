# TaskOps

TaskOps is a task management and analytics system that allows users to create, update, and track tasks while viewing insights through analytics.

This project was built as a **hands-on learning exercise** to explore **Next.js, GraphQL, Apollo Federation, and system design concepts** using a **microservices-based architecture**.
